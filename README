The files in this repository are from my project "Detecting Solar Arrays Using a Convolutional Neural Network to Analyze their Development on Agricultural Land in Massachusetts" which I undertook in the summer-fall of 2022 for my masters degree at Penn State. All shapefiles may be used with proper attribution. The vector shapefiles show predicted ground-based solar arrays in Hampden, Hampshire, Plymouth, and Barnstable counties, MA. Most false positives were removed by applying filtering rules to the datasets. These shapefiles can be used to estimate array areas within counties and perform other land-use analyses. The shapefiles were produced by running a trained CNN model with a U-Net configuration on 30 cm resolution, 4-band imagery of MA taken in 2021 and merging the output. In the future I intend to add vector datasets of other counties, some base code of the model, and a comprehensive report of land use conversion caused by solar array construction in the state.
